    An object which represents a contract that may be signed by a Client to be
    notified by one or more dealers, providing one or more model keys for each
    Dealer.

    Each pair of Dealer and model_key is stored as a SubscriptionItem.

    A Subscription distinguishes three states:

    * Acquired: A Client has been associated with the Subscription (in other
      words, it has signed the contract). In order for a client to acquire a
      Subscription it needs to know its subscription_token.

    * WaitingClient: No client has acquired the Subscription yet. The
      Subscription object will store any deltas for the subscription items and
      forward them to the Client when it acquires the Subscription.

    * Stale: Time has passed since the Subscription was created but no Client
      has acquired it. Subscriptions in this state will be removed by the
      system in order to free memory.
