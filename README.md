This is a demonstration of how [Snorky](http://snorkyproject.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) enable developers to easily build real time web applications. It shows a simple user assistance tool, where clients can login with their email and open issues. You can also login as an administrator, view the list of issues and reply to them.

All the views are synchronized to the database with Snorky. You don't need to refresh the page when a new issue is created or replied.

Open two browsers, log in as client in one and as admin in other and see how data is automatically shown with almost no delay.
